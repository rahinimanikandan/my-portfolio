            <h3> Short note: </h3>
        <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game implemented using the C programming language. This project features a simple command-line interface where players take turns marking their symbols ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The program ensures valid moves, checks for a winner after each turn, and declares the result accordingly. It demonstrates my ability to apply programming logic, use arrays for grid representation, and implement game logic effectively.</p>
             <h3> Description: </h3>
        <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that requires strategic thinking and decision-making. This project is a command-line implementation of the game using the C programming language, demonstrating my ability to develop interactive applications with structured programming concepts. The game follows the standard 3x3 grid format, where two players alternately place their respective marks ('X' and 'O') on the board. The primary objective is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win the game. If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

            <br>The implementation is structured using functions to ensure modularity and ease of understanding. A 2D array is used to represent the game board, and functions handle board initialization, user input validation, board display, and winner detection. The program continuously checks for a win condition after each move, ensuring real-time feedback for the players. Additionally, input validation prevents overwriting of already occupied cells, ensuring fair gameplay. The game loops until a player wins or the board is full, after which the result is displayed, and players have the option to restart the game.
            
            <br>This project highlights my ability to work with fundamental programming constructs such as loops, conditional statements, arrays, and functions. It also demonstrates my problem-solving skills and logical thinking in implementing a real-world game scenario. By developing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of handling user interactions, managing game flow efficiently, and structuring code in a readable and maintainable manner. This Tic-Tac-Toe game serves as a strong example of my ability to develop interactive console applications and apply core programming concepts effectively.</p>

            <h3> Short note: </h3>
        <p>A To-Do List is a simple web application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It uses Local Storage to save tasks, ensuring they persist even after the page is reloaded. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating JavaScript's DOM manipulation and event handling.</p>
        <h3> Description: </h3>
        <p>The To-Do List with Local Storage is a small yet essential web project for beginners in web development. It allows users to create a task list where they can add new tasks, delete completed ones, and mark tasks as done. The key feature is the use of Local Storage, which ensures that even after refreshing the page or closing the browser, the task list remains intact.</p>

        <p><b><span style="color:#0202117e">Working Principle</span></b>
            <br>
            <ol class="order-list">
            <li>The To-Do List with Local Storage operates by dynamically creating and managing tasks in a structured list format. Users can add tasks, which are displayed instantly in the UI. When a task is marked as completed or deleted, the changes are updated both in the UI and Local Storage.The key mechanism behind Local Storage:</li>
               <li>When a task is added, it's saved in Local Storage as an array.</li>
               <li>When the page loads, tasks are retrieved from Local Storage and displayed.</li>
               <li>When a task is removed, the Local Storage is updated accordingly.</li>
        </ol></p>
        <p><b><span style="color:#0202117e" >Functions and Their Purpose</span></b>

            <li> <b>Adding a Task: </b>
                <br>
                The user enters a task in the input field and clicks "Add".<br>
                JavaScript captures the input value and creates a new list element.<br>
                This new task is stored in Local Storage as part of an array.<br>
                The updated list is displayed in the UI.</li>
            <li>
                <b>Marking a Task as Completed:</b>
                <br>
                When a task is clicked, JavaScript toggles the completed class.<br>
                The style changes (e.g., strikethrough effect) to indicate completion.<br>
                This change is also updated in Local Storage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Deleting a Task:</b>
                <br>
                When the delete button is clicked, JavaScript removes the corresponding list from the DOM.<br>
                The task is also removed from Local Storage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Retrieving Data from Local Storage on Page Load:</b>
                <br>
                When the page reloads, JavaScript retrieves the saved task list from Local Storage.<br>
                The tasks are re-created and displayed in the UI.
            </li>
